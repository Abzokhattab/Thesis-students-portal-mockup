# intro 
this project is just a mockup interface for thesis students and their doctors where they can connect with them or view the latest thesis 
reseaches on specfic topic and interact with their publishers .

# Theme
The theme of the project is extending the GUC university Administration Web Portal. It will focus on supporting the
postgraduate students and professors through enabling them to collaborate remotely (online) on writing
and reviewing their thesis or conference and journal submissions. You will design a web portal that will
enable the GUC postgraduate students to collaborate with internal professors, as well as professors from
external global universities. We will refer to it as “PostGrad Collaboration Portal”.

the following link includes the following requirements

1. Storyboard 
  A graphical representation of the Storyboard discussing the motivation for the using the platform in different senarios . 
  
2. StoryMap 
  discuss the user journey in the platform knowing that the uploaded version isnt the final one we have added other features such as
  after uploading the thesis in the platform a machine learning model will scan the file and give you a guide line for the next step 
  and tell the user about how much is their progress in the thesis for example ( you have completed the introduction with 10% progress in 
  your thesis and the next step is thesis statement (for example) )
  
3. User and System requirement
  set of documentation that describes the features and behavior of a system or software application. It includes a variety of elements 
  that attempts to define the intended functionality required by the customer to satisfy their different users.
  
4. Non-functional requirments 
  discuss the non-functional requirements in the software such as responsiveness and high performance  
  
5. The Sequence Diagrams
  describing, for each subsystem, the two most-dependent-on requirements.

6. The Class Diagram
   describing all the entities and their interactions in the system.
   
7. API sheet 
   Create the regression test cases of the main features related to the remote collaboration on writing and reviewing the thesis or conference and journal submissions. However, and
   this is really important, you are testing the functionalities as if the APIs responsible for enabling
   the features of the collaboration are already implemented.

# development journey 
create a midto-high fidelity clickable mockup of the main user journeys within this MVP.
  . first we developed a basic user interface to test the functionality first and user journey 
   in this clickable mockup : https://gradstudentportal.invisionapp.com/prototype/k-ck9wstn97005zta01ssop6ng1/play/59bedaa6?v=SIRoKarO%2Fqn4pgoRgFeMbw%3D%3D&linkshare=urlcopied
    After performing usablity testing and getting feedbacks from users

  then we created this mockup interface to improve ux
